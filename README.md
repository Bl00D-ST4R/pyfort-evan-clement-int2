Description : This is our "Fort boyard project". It is a school project where we had to recreate a "fort boyard" like game in python.

Key features : You can create a team of up to 3 players, and then you play a serie of minigames/challenges to earn keys. Once you hae 3 keys, you unlock the treasure room.
In the treasure room, you're faced with the final challenge, where you have to guess a code word to win.

Technologies used : The code is all in python, using the json and random import for some of the fucntion. The data is in json

Installation : just unzip and play the main.py

How to use :
To play, you have to launch the game() function (located in main.py) in the console, and every part of the gameplay is displayed in said console.

Game algorithm : 
First you are briefly introduced to the game, then compose your team of players.
When you have finished, you have to choose a player and a type of challenge to play
